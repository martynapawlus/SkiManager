This project is a mobile application for Android users dedicated for ski school clients who want to sign up for lessons. Each client has its own account so it can use application functionalities such as signing up for new lessons, canceling incoming lessons, rating past lessons and changing old passwords.  
All necessary data is stored on server so an app needs to be connected to the internet while using.  <br><br>
